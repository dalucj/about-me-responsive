  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  <p>I am a married father of two children. Its difficult to describe my nationality as I have lived in three countries and hold two passports and citizenships. I could hold three but that would just be ridiculous! I completed a bachelor of engineering degree
  in electronics and communication systems, and have been working in professional services providing consultancy in IT/Networking. In 2004 I achieved CCIE certifiction, a valued industry qualification. I am know embarking upon the next chapter and would like to become a developer and hopefully augment my networking and development skills. Networking is about to undergo a massive evolution with software defined networking leading the way in the brave new world.</p>

  <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
  <p>I was born in Rotorua, New Zealand. Thats right that smelly sulphur place with geysers and bubbling mud pools. A great place to grow up! I was fortunate to spend 11 years in New Zealand before my family migrated to Perth, Australia. The most isolated city in the world. Great weather and the best beaches. After getting married in Perth to my wife Fiona we moved to the UK and have spent the last 16 years in London. London is now home for us with well established roots. Its a great city!</p>

  <h1>More About Me</h1>
  <h2>What are your favorite hobbies?</h2>
  <p>I enjoy reading both fiction and non-fiction. Currently I'm reading Lean Startup, Pheonix Project and Game of Thrones. If there is one sport I will always make time for its hockey. Even though the body is not so capable these days its a great team sport.</p>
  <h2>What's your dream job?</h2>
  <p>Something that keeps me challenged, allows flexibilty for work life balance. Oh yeah and it pays the mortgage, drop me a note if anyone has any openings fitting the above criteria.</p>
  <h2>  What's important to you?</h2>
  <p>Things that are important to me are life, learning and compassion. I always like to put myself in other peoples shoes and try and understand situations from their perspective.</p>
  <h2>What music have you been listening to lately?</h2>
  <p>I don't like to admit it but I like cheesy pop, and love the yearly playlists my wife creates. Been listening to Pharell Williams, Mark Ronson, Aloe Black, and Jay-Z recently to mention a few. Don't mind a bit of old school R&B and Rap, you know Snoop,
    Tupac, Dr DRE, Naughty by Nature.</p>
